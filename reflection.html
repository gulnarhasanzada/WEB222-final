                <h5>Responsive design and web technologies</h5>
                <p>
                    Responsive design is a way of developing applications so that the way that app is displayed depends on the screen size of the device using it. Designers use relative measurement units, like % and apply media queries to adapt the web application to browsers size. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the early days of the internet web sites only were used in PC and laptops. Although, developers used fixed size it was not an issue. As long as it looked good on a laptop, the website would look almost the same in any other monitor.</p>
                <p>
                     However, arrival of mobile computing has changed everything. A website that looks nice on laptop would look messy on mobile. Large objects, fonts divs wouldn’t fit on small sizes, so it required scrolling, zooming in and out all the time. So, web sites were not user-friendly on mobile. 
Therefore, developers started to use adaptive design. They started to build 6 different and fixed sized GUI-s for different device sizes (320, 480, 760, 960, 1200, and 1600 pixels). Based on device size browsers would define which design to display. However, it was very expensive solution and devices with non-standard size didn’t have an optimal view. 
                </p>
               <p>
                   Use of relative sizes has solved many problems in modern responsive web design. For example, width: 100% would work for every device. For browser window that has 1280px size it would mean 1280px and for mobile it would mean 320px. So, one design can fit for every device. Fluid grid systems, fluid images and media queries are three main principles used in building of modern responsive apps. There are many frameworks that can help designers to build fully responsive websites. For instance, Bootstrap is on of the most popular ones and it’s free.

                 <p>
                    Through this research I learned:

                 <ul>
                    <li> How evolution of devices and the internet has changed the understanding of web design and lead   to the development of responsive design</li>
                    <li>Two different methods used to make websites user-friendly in every device: Adaptive and responsive design</li>
                    <li>Similarities and differences between adaptive and responsive design</li>
                    <li>Some frameworks that support responsive design</li> 
                 </ul>
                 <h5>WEB 222</h5>
                 <p>
                    In WEB 222 I learned basics of web development. We started from JavaScript, then HTML, CSS and finally Ajax. Although, course material was very large it was interesting to learn building web pages. I particularly, loved working with JavaScript. I loved the way it was flexible and easier to code compared to C++.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    I loved my professors teaching style. They were very friendly, fun, and ready to help all the time. The only thing I would like to change about this course is its flow. I wish we started from HTML and CSS and then JavaScript. This way I believe it would be easier to understand the functions that work with DOM.
